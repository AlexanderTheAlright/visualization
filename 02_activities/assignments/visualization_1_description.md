# Visualization 1: No Room at the Inn

**Software:** Python (matplotlib + seaborn)

**Intended audience:** Municipal policymakers and social services planners in Toronto who need a clear, at-a-glance picture of shelter system pressure. These are people who already know the system is strained but need something concrete to bring to budget meetings and council presentations.

**Message:** Toronto shelters operated at or above 95% bed occupancy across every sector and nearly every month of 2024. The heatmap makes the uniformity of this pressure hard to ignore. It is not a seasonal spike or a problem concentrated in one population — it is system-wide and year-round. The only visible dip is in the Youth sector toward year-end, and even that barely drops below 90%.

**Design considerations:** I went with a heatmap because it lets you see patterns across two dimensions (time and sector) simultaneously, which is something a bar chart would struggle to do without becoming cluttered. This fits with what we discussed about cognitive load — the viewer can take in the overall pattern at a glance without having to compare individual bars from memory. The viridis colormap is perceptually uniform, which means equal steps in the data correspond to equal visual steps in colour. I used white cell borders to keep each value distinct (Gestalt principle of enclosure) and added white-bordered annotation boxes in each cell so you can read exact percentages without squinting. The title and subtitle are positioned at the top left following a consistent layout convention, and the data source is cited at the bottom of the figure, which is one of the four conventions Kennedy et al. (2016) found reinforces perceived objectivity.

**Reproducibility:** The script reads directly from the City of Toronto Open Data API, so anyone with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn installed can run it and get the same output. All filtering and aggregation steps are in the code. There is no manual data manipulation outside the script.

**Accessibility:** Viridis was specifically designed to be readable for people with colour vision deficiency and to maintain contrast in grayscale print. The annotation boxes mean you do not have to rely on colour alone to read the values. Font sizes are 11pt or higher throughout, and I used sans-serif fonts, which are generally more accessible for people with cognitive disabilities (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013). Alt-text: "Heatmap showing average monthly bed occupancy rates for four Toronto shelter sectors (Women, Men, Mixed Adult, Youth) in 2024. Nearly all cells show 95–100% occupancy, with slight dips in the Youth sector toward December."

**Impacted communities:** People experiencing homelessness in Toronto are the most directly affected by this data. The visualization categorizes them into shelter sectors, which reflects how the system is administered but also collapses a lot of individual complexity into four labels. The Families sector is absent here because it operates on room-based capacity rather than beds, which means an entire population is invisible in this particular view. The data also cannot capture people who were turned away or who never attempted to access a shelter.

**Feature selection:** I used bed-based occupancy rates rather than raw counts because rates make cross-sector comparison meaningful even when sectors differ in size. I excluded the Families sector because it had no bed-based data, and including an empty row would have been misleading. Monthly averages smooth out daily noise while still preserving seasonal patterns.

**Underwater labour:** This data exists because frontline shelter staff log occupancy numbers every day, often under difficult conditions. The City of Toronto's open data team maintains the portal and keeps the data structured and accessible. The standardization work that makes it possible to compare numbers across different shelter operators is invisible but essential.
