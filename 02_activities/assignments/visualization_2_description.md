# Visualization 2: Where Do They Sleep?

**Software:** Plotly (Python-based interactive visualization library, distinct from matplotlib)

**Intended audience:** Journalists, advocacy groups, and members of the public who want to understand not just how full the shelter system is, but what that system actually looks like. Most people think of shelters as one thing. This chart shows that the reality includes motel and hotel programs, 24-hour respite sites, warming centres, and other overflow infrastructure.

**Message:** Traditional shelters account for the largest share of service users, but motel and hotel shelter programs absorb a massive number of people too — sometimes rivaling traditional shelters. The stacked area format makes it easy to see both the total volume (around 300,000 service users per month) and the composition. Warming centres appear only in winter months, which gives a sense of how the system flexes seasonally. The overall volume stays remarkably stable throughout the year, reinforcing the takeaway from Visualization 1 that this is not a temporary crisis.

**Design considerations:** A stacked area chart works well here because it shows part-to-whole relationships over time, which is what the Financial Times Visual Vocabulary recommends for this kind of data. The viridis colour palette samples across the full spectrum so each service type gets a distinct hue while staying perceptually uniform. Hover tooltips provide exact counts for any month without cluttering the static view, which helps with the cognitive load issue we discussed in class — viewers get the overview first and can drill in for detail. The legend is placed below the chart in a horizontal layout to avoid competing with the data area. The data source and record count are noted at the bottom.

**Reproducibility:** The script reads from the City of Toronto Open Data API and the HTML output can be opened in any modern browser. All data transformations are in the code. Interactive visualizations are inherently less portable than static images since you need either the HTML file or the script to reproduce them, but the code is self-contained and commented.

**Accessibility:** The viridis palette maintains contrast for people with colour vision deficiency and in grayscale. The hover tooltips provide an alternative channel for accessing exact values. One real limitation is that interactive Plotly charts are not natively accessible to screen readers. For full accessibility, a static image with detailed alt-text would be needed alongside the HTML. Alt-text for a static version: "Stacked area chart showing monthly service user totals by overnight service type in Toronto, 2024. Traditional shelters and motel/hotel programs together account for the vast majority of users. Total volume stays around 290,000–310,000 per month. Warming centres appear only in January–April and December."

**Impacted communities:** Everyone who passes through these programs is represented as a count in this chart. The service type categories reveal something about the experience: a person in a motel/hotel shelter has a very different night than someone in a warming centre. Collapsing smaller categories into "Other" is a practical choice for readability, but it hides programs like isolation and recovery sites that serve people during health crises.

**Feature selection:** I collapsed the nine service types into six categories (five named, one "Other") to keep the chart readable. I used total monthly service user counts rather than occupancy rates because the question here is about scale and composition, not capacity utilization. Rates would not make sense for a stacked area chart since they are not additive.

**Underwater labour:** Same frontline data collection labour as Visualization 1. The interactive format also depends on the open-source Plotly library and the work of its maintainers. The City's data team categorizes each program by service type, which is the classification that makes this entire visualization possible.
